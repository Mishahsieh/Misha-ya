        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Hockey: </h2><p class="text"> Hockey a sport that can be separated into 2 kinds. The first one
        is, Ice hockey. Thesecond one is the normal hockey, the one you use on grass. I, personally think ice hockey is more difficult
        than the normal hockey, because in ice hockey, you also have to learn iceskating, and in my opinion, ice skating is very hard.
        Anyway, ice hockey is a sport kind of like goalball, the diffrence is you have to score the ball into the net, but in
         goalfball, you have to score the ball into a hole, which is much more difficult.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">4. tennis: </h2><p class="text"> Tennis is a sport that includes running and swining your arms, 
        it's kind of like two sports sdded together, running and the arms for swimming, so if you like to swim and run, I suggest you
        yo try out tennis, but when you play tennis, it's gonna be very VERY hot!!!! So remember to wear sunscreen, and if you like,
         you can add a hat too, these are just my suggestions, it depends on you.</p>

        <b><h2 class="subtitle">5. vollyball: </b></h2><p class="text"> Vollyball is a sport that includes teamwork, because you have
        to hit the ball up high, and ANOTHER person has to hit the ball to the other team, and that includes teamwork and alsotacit
        agreement. Vollyball is actually pretty fun for myself. And I'll tell you guys something if you think you're short and you 
        think you can't play vollyball, but that isn't true, the shorter people an be the one to get the ball from hitting the floor, 
        so you actually have a reall important role play!</p>
